How Gmail protects your privacy & keeps you in control
Keeping you safe online means protecting your information and respecting your privacy. That’s why, in every product we make, we focus on keeping your information secure, treating it responsibly, and keeping you in control. Our teams work every day to make Google products safe no matter what you’re doing—browsing the web, managing your inbox, or getting directions.

Protecting your privacy starts with keeping your data secure. Your information is protected by world-class security, monitoring things like suspicious logins and unauthorized activity. You can always control your privacy settings in your Google Account.

For general information about privacy on Gmail, keep reading this article.

For details about privacy in work and school accounts, use the Google Workspace Security Resources.
A more helpful & personalized experience for you
When you use Gmail, we offer you personalized and assistive experiences, such as Smart Reply, by processing some data. Your information stays secure. You can always control your privacy settings in your Google Account.

Your content is stored securely
When you send an email or text message, send attachments, or record video meetings, it is stored securely in our world-class data centers. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. If you choose to access this data offline, we store this info on your device.

Your name & email address help sync your data and keep you updated
To store your preferences, help you sign in, get you files you've uploaded through other devices, and inform you of service changes, we use your name and email address. To make it easy to write emails, we use your contacts.

Use your information to create & manage your Google Account
To create a brand new Google account, we collect your name and phone number. When you manage your Google account, you can choose to provide your physical address, upload your contacts, or add a profile photo.

Data is used to improve your Gmail experience
To provide you features like smart inbox categories, Smart Compose, and spam detection, we use Gmail data to provide a more intelligent email experience and keep you safe.

To improve Gmail’s performance and reliability, and to help with troubleshooting in case of issues while you use Gmail, we collect performance data and crash analytics. We also use this info to help prevent abuse of our services and for analysis. We never sell your personal information, and you have choices over how your information is used.

Sync your services with your location
To understand how your experience of the product may relate to geography, like when you send feedback to Google, and to keep your account secure, like if we notice you have signed in from a new location, we use some location info. For example, we’ll proactively notify you if we detect something we think you should know about, like a suspicious login or a malicious website, file, or app, and we’ll provide guidance to help you strengthen your security.

We do not scan or read your Gmail messages to show you ads
If you have a work or school account, you will never be shown ads in Gmail.

When you use your personal Google account and open the promotions or social tabs in Gmail, you'll see ads that were selected to be the most useful and relevant for you. The process of selecting and showing personalized ads in Gmail is fully automated. These ads are shown to you based on your online activity while you're signed into Google, however we do not process email content to serve ads.

To remember which ads you've dismissed, avoid showing you the same ads, and show you ads you may like better, we save your past ad interactions, like which ads you've clicked or dismissed.

You can adjust your ad settings anytime. Learn more about Gmail ads.

Learn how Google detects & reports online child sex abuse
Gmail detects online child sexual abuse under the Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, which provides for a derogation from the confidentiality of communications under Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of the Directive 2002/58/EC for the purpose of combating online child sexual abuse.

Google does not allow the use of our services to create, upload, or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. To keep our service safe we use technology (i.e. hash matching) to detect such content. If we find such content, we will take appropriate action, which may include removing the content and disabling accounts. Users whose accounts are disabled are provided with information on available redress avenues if the user disagrees with our decision. Users within the European Union can also lodge a complaint to their country’s relevant data protection authority and they have the right to seek a judicial remedy as laid out in the Regulation 2021/1232.

Relevant information, which may include personal information and the violative content, is reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), which in turn forwards reports to law enforcement authorities around the world, as appropriate.

Stay in control of your content with easy-to-use settings

Your data and Gemini Apps
This notice and our Privacy Policy describe how Google handles your data when you interact with our Gemini Apps. “Gemini Apps” refers to our conversational AI service for consumers in apps and services that reference this notice.

In the European Economic Area and Switzerland, Gemini Apps are provided by Google Ireland Limited. In the United Kingdom, Gemini Apps are provided by Google LLC. We refer to Google Ireland Limited and Google LLC below as Google.

What data is collected and how it’s used
Google collects your Gemini Apps conversations, related product usage information, info about your location, and your feedback. Google uses this data, consistent with our Privacy Policy, to provide, improve, and develop Google products and services and machine-learning technologies, including Google’s enterprise products such as Google Cloud.

Gemini Apps Activity is on by default if you are 18 or older. Users under 18 can choose to turn it on.

If your Gemini Apps Activity setting is on, Google stores your Gemini Apps activity with your Google Account for up to 18 months. You can change this to 3 or 36 months in your Gemini Apps Activity setting. Info about your location, including the general area from your device, IP address, or Home or Work addresses in your Google Account, is also stored with your Gemini Apps activity. Learn more at g.co/privacypolicy/location.

How human reviewers improve Google AI
To help with quality and improve our products (such as generative machine-learning models that power Gemini Apps), human reviewers read, annotate, and process your Gemini Apps conversations. We take steps to protect your privacy as part of this process. This includes disconnecting your conversations with Gemini Apps from your Google Account before reviewers see or annotate them. Please don’t enter confidential information in your conversations or any data you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve our products, services, and machine-learning technologies.

Configuring your settings
Visit your Google Account to access settings and tools that let you safeguard your data and protect your privacy.

To stop future conversations from being reviewed or used to improve Google machine-learning technologies, turn off Gemini Apps Activity. You can review your prompts or delete your conversations from your Gemini Apps Activity at myactivity.google.com/product/gemini.

Conversations that have been reviewed or annotated by human reviewers (and related data like your language, device type, location info, or feedback) are not deleted when you delete your Gemini Apps activity because they are kept separately and are not connected to your Google Account. Instead, they are retained for up to three years.

Even when Gemini Apps Activity is off, your conversations will be saved with your account for up to 72 hours. This lets Google provide the service and process any feedback. This activity won’t appear in your Gemini Apps Activity. Learn more.

How Gemini Apps Activity works with other services and settings
If you turn off this setting or delete your Gemini Apps activity, other Google data settings won’t change. Those settings, like Web & App Activity or Location History, may keep saving location and other data as you use other Google services. You can also integrate and use Gemini Apps with other Google services. When you do, those services save and use your data to provide and improve their services, consistent with their policies and the Google Privacy Policy. If you use Gemini Apps to interact with third-party services, they will process your data according to their own privacy policies.

Requesting content removal and exporting your information
You can request the removal of content under our policies or applicable laws. You can also export your information.

Things to know
Gemini Apps are a new technology. They are continuously evolving and may sometimes give inaccurate, offensive, or inappropriate information that doesn’t represent Google’s views.
Don’t rely on responses from Gemini Apps as medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.
Your feedback will help make Gemini Apps better.
