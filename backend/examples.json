When Gemini is your mobile assistant, Google processes additional information to understand and respond to you and give you hands-free help. This data helps us provide, improve, and develop Google products, services, and machine-learning technologies, like those that power Gemini Apps. Here are a few examples: Gemini Apps use your past conversations, location, and related info to generate a response. We review your feedback and use it to help make Gemini Apps safer. We also use it to help reduce common problems with large language models. Your Gemini Apps conversations are not being used to show you ads. If this changes, we will clearly communicate it to you. We take your privacy seriously, and we do not sell your personal information to anyone. To help Gemini improve while protecting your privacy, we select a subset of conversations and use automated tools to help remove user identifying information (such as email addresses and phone numbers). These sample conversations are reviewed by trained reviewers and kept for up to three years, separately from your Google Account. Google uses conversations (as well as feedback and related data) from Gemini Apps users to improve Google products (such as the generative machine-learning models that power Gemini Apps), so we can make them safer, more helpful, and work better for all users. Human review is a necessary step of the model improvement process. Through their review, rating, and rewrites, humans help enable quality improvements of generative machine-learning models like the ones that power Gemini Apps. Location data is always collected if you use Gemini Apps so that they can provide you with a response that is relevant to your query. For example, to respond to prompts like What's the weather?, Gemini Apps need to know your location. If available, Gemini Apps may share your precise location data with another Google service, like Google Maps, to fulfill your request.",
